This suggests an opportunity to increase revenue by capitalizing on the value customers place on having a balcony. Additionally, our balcony rooms average slightly larger square footage (461 sq ft) compared to the competition (458 sq ft). Highlighting this difference can help justify a price increase and attract customers seeking more spacious accommodations."
