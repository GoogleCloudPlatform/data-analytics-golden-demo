        "We should consider slightly increasing the price of our rooms with balconies to better align with competitor pricing, as they are charging a premium for balcony rooms. We should also consider highlighting the slightly larger average square footage of our balcony rooms as a value add when compared to competitors.\n",

        "**Reasoning:**\n",
        "The data shows competitors are charging an average of \\$308 for balcony rooms, while we are charging $286. This suggests an opportunity to increase revenue by capitalizing on the value customers place on having a balcony. Additionally, our balcony rooms average slightly larger square footage (461 sq ft) compared to the competition (458 sq ft). Highlighting this difference can help justify a price increase and attract customers seeking more spacious accommodations."
