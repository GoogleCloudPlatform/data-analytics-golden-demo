 Prerequisites:
    - Run the Airflow DAG: sample-dataplex-with-hms-deploy
        - This DAG can take 45 minutes to deploy.  Dataproc metastore can take a while.
        - NOTE: Your Dataplex and Dataproc Metastore will be deleted after 48 hours (to save on costs). 
        -       ** This means all your scripts / notebooks will be DELETED!  So save them inside of storage or somewhere safe. **
        -       You will need to re-run the DAG sample-dataplex-with-hms-deploy to deploy again.

    - In the console open your Taxi Data Lake:
        - https://console.cloud.google.com/dataplex/lakes/taxi-data-lake-93b2hjnp0r;location=us-central1/environments?project=data-analytics-demo-93b2hjnp0r&supportedpurview=project
        - Click "Create Default Environment"
        - Click on the Details tab
            - Make sure your metastore is ready to use (e.g.): Metastore status: Ready as of June 14, 2023 at 10:52:03â€¯AM UTC-4

    - It can then take another 45 minutes for Dataplex to scan and initialize

    - Goto the Explore UI:
        - https://console.cloud.google.com/dataplex/explore/lakes/taxi-data-lake-93b2hjnp0r;location=us-central1/query/workbench?project=data-analytics-demo-93b2hjnp0r&supportedpurview=project
        - Make sure Taxi Data Lake is selected 
            - NOTE: If you do not see any "tables" in the left hand side, then your Metastore might still be initializing
            - NOTE: The Dataproc Metastore is ONLY mounted to the Taxi Data Lake and not the others.  Each Data Lake requires its own Metastore (at this point in time).
