/*
Use Cases:
    - Show row level security on OMNI tables (CSV, JSON and Parquet formats)
    
Description: 
    - Filter rows by a Pickup Location

Show:
    - Tables are filter by rows even though it is a parquet file

Clean up / Reset script:
    - DROP ALL ROW ACCESS POLICIES ON `${project_id}.${aws_omni_biglake_dataset_name}.taxi_s3_yellow_trips_parquet_rls`;
    - DROP ALL ROW ACCESS POLICIES ON `${project_id}.${aws_omni_biglake_dataset_name}.taxi_s3_yellow_trips_csv_rls`;
    - DROP ALL ROW ACCESS POLICIES ON `${project_id}.${aws_omni_biglake_dataset_name}.taxi_s3_yellow_trips_json_rls`;

-- NOTE: The tables are named with a suffix of "_rls", this is so we do not affect the demo.  
--       In the real application of RLS you do not need a seperate table.

-- Create row level security policies on the Parquet, CSV and JSON files
-- NOTE: This has already been done (you do not have acces to run)
