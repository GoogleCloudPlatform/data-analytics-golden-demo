Use Cases:
    - Customers that use Databricks typically use Delta.io (aka Delta Lake format)
    - This shows how BigQuery can read Delta.io (Hive partitioning is supported for both the data and manifest files)
    - Time travel is not supported with this apporach

    - Delta.io format consists of parquet files (which BigQuery can read) along with logs files that track changes to the parquet files over time.  
      A delta directory has many parquet files some of which are logically deleted.
      So, if you read all the parquet files, you end up with too much data.  The delta logs tell you which files contain the latest data (not logically deleted).

    - How it works:
      You will issue a Delta command to create a manifest file (or files if the data is partitioned)
      You are responsible for generating and keeping the manifest up to date.
            Databricks is capable of keeping the manifest file up to date automatically, but you need to issue a command like the following:
            ALTER TABLE delta.`<path-to-delta-table>` SET TBLPROPERTIES(delta.compatibility.symlinkFormatManifest.enabled=true)
      An external table will be created over the parquet files
      An external table will be created over the manifest files
      A view will join the two tables together and filter the parquet files to the ones with the latest data.

Description: 
    - Shows creating a view that abtracts the Delta.io format
    - NOTE: Customers must generate a manifest file for this to work.  This is done in Databricks or with their Delta.io SDK.

Reference:
    - 

Clean up / Reset script:
    DROP VIEW IF EXISTS `${project_id}.${azure_omni_biglake_dataset_name}.rideshare_trips`;
    DROP EXTERNAL TABLE IF EXISTS `${project_id}.${azure_omni_biglake_dataset_name}.rideshare_trips_raw_parquet`;
    DROP EXTERNAL TABLE IF EXISTS `${project_id}.${azure_omni_biglake_dataset_name}.rideshare_trips_manifest`;

Sample PySpark code to generate a manifest:
    %python
    from delta.tables import *

    spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.symlinkFormatManifest.fileSystemCheck.enabled", False)

    # Generate manifest
    deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark,"azure://${azure_omni_biglake_adls_name}.blob.core.windows.net/datalake/delta_io/rideshare_trips/")
    deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest")
