Clean up / Reset script:

*/

-- Open the table and view the schema
-- You will see columns with security applied
-- There is High Security on the Fare_Amount and Total_Amount (we do not have access to these fields)
-- There is Low Security on the "other" amount fields (we have access to these)

-- NOTE: The tables are named with a suffix of "_cls", this is so we do not affect the demo.  
--       In the real application of CLS you do not need a seperate table.

--- CSV FORMAT
-- This will error since we try to select the Fare_Amount and Total_Amount
SELECT *
  FROM `azure_omni_biglake.taxi_azure_yellow_trips_csv_cls`
 WHERE year = 2021
   AND month = 1  
LIMIT 1000;


-- This will work since we do not select the column's we do not have access
SELECT * EXCEPT (Fare_Amount,Total_Amount)
  FROM `azure_omni_biglake.taxi_azure_yellow_trips_csv_cls`
 WHERE year = 2021
   AND month = 1  
LIMIT 1000;


-- JSON FORMAT
-- This will error since we try to select the Fare_Amount and Total_Amount
SELECT *
  FROM `azure_omni_biglake.taxi_azure_yellow_trips_json_cls`
 WHERE year = 2021
   AND month = 1  
LIMIT 1000;


-- This will work since we do not select the column's we do not have access
SELECT * EXCEPT (Fare_Amount,Total_Amount)
  FROM `azure_omni_biglake.taxi_azure_yellow_trips_json_cls`
 WHERE year = 2021

-- PARQUET FORMAT
-- This will error since we try to select the Fare_Amount and Total_Amount
SELECT *
