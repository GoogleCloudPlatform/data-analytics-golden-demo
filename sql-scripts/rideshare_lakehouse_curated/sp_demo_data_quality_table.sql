/*
Use Cases:
    - Gets the Aggreated Data Quality (Dataplex) results for a table
    - This will be called by Airflow DAG: sample-dataplex-run-data-quality

Description: 
    - Shows gathering the data which will be ingeted into the Data Catalog Tag Template
    - You could make this procedure more generic and pass in the table as a parameter (this is just a demo)
    - You could also deploy this to the dataplex_data_quality dataset (instead of taxi)

Show:
    -
