Use Cases:
    - General overview of BigQuery recent features
    

Running this demo:
    - Start the Spanner Airflow DAG: sample-bigquery-start-spanner (takes about 10 minutes to deploy and shuts down after 4 hours)
    - Start the Datastream Airflow DAG: sample-datastream-private-ip-deploy (takes about 10 minutes to deploy)
        - Start the Change Data Capture (generate data) DAG: sample-datastream-private-ip-generate-data (starts immedately)
    - Start the Dataflow Airflow DAG: sample-dataflow-start-streaming-job (takes about 10 minutes to deploy and shuts down after 4 hours)
    - Run the managed notebook DAG: sample-create-managed-notebook (takes about 5 minutes to deploy)
    -   You should run the notebook: BigQuery-Create-TensorFlow-Model.ipynb 
    - Run the Iceberg table DAG: sample-iceberg-create-tables-update-data (takes about 15 minutes to deploy)
    - Start the Data Quality DAG: sample-rideshare-run-data-quality (takes about 10 minutes to complete)
    - Log into https://atomfashion.io/analytics/salesoverview and switch to Premium Account
    - Run the below "DO THIS IN ADVANCE"
    - Run a manual Data Profile of table: ${project_id}.${bigquery_rideshare_lakehouse_curated_dataset}.bigquery_rideshare_trip
      - https://console.cloud.google.com/dataplex/govern/profile?project=${project_id}
