Use Cases:
    - Need to ingest, store and query JSON data.  BigQuery supports the JSON data type in addition to storing JSON as string.
    -
    
Description: 
    - Create an external table over json files in your data lake/storage
    - Ingest the data into an internal table storing the data as JSON
    - Write queries againsts the data and join to other tables
    - Insert data into the table
    - Query array elements in the JSON

Reference:
    - https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json-data
    - https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#json_type

Clean up / Reset script:
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `${project_id}.${bigquery_taxi_dataset}.ext_taxi_trips_json`;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `${project_id}.${bigquery_taxi_dataset}.taxi_trips_json`;
