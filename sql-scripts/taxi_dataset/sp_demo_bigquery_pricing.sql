IMPORTANT: If you create Capacity, you MUST DROP it or else you will get BILLED.  See the end of the script!

Use Cases:
    - Pricing for companies that want a warehouse do not want a commit can use ad-hoc pricing
    - Pricing for companies that want a fixed cost model can use reservations pricing model

Description: 
    - Discuss ad-hoc vs slot base billing
    - Show the ad-hoc pricing query
    - Show the steps to create a resevation and assign it
    - Discuss how un-used slots are used accross the entire organization.  Other warehouses are constrained to sharing
      capacity within a cluster.  BigQuery has no such contraint and un-used slots are shared for your entire company.  If
      a query is submitted and fails under a reservation in which another job is utilizing the idle resources BigQuery scales
      back the running query to begin execution of the new query. 
    - Discuss slots can be purchased in 100 level increments.  Others warehouse double your pricing when scaling and incremental
      growth is not possible leading to high costs.
